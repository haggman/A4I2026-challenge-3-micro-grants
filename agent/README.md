# Your agent goes here

This folder is empty on purpose.

We built the on-ramp: a real commercial corridor, real businesses, one fully real
business-to-business relationship, two modelled ones built on published federal rates, a
neighbourhood need signal, and a validation suite that tells you plainly whether any of it is
wrong. We did not build the vehicle. The design decisions in your agent are what you are judged
on.

## What has to be true of what you build here

- **An ADK agent**, in Python.
- **At least one tool you built yourself.** A Python function tool, or one you defined in MCP
  Toolbox — either counts. The obvious candidate wraps your cascade query. The more valuable one
  holds the logic that is not a single query: deciding what counts as exposure, weighting a path,
  turning a set of paths into a funding recommendation with an amount attached. Consuming only
  prebuilt generic tools and calling that your design does not count.
- **At least one Google-managed MCP server, consumed.** Do not author your own — use BigQuery's
  built-in server or the [MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox).
- **Deployed to Google Cloud** — Agent Runtime or Cloud Run, your choice.
- **Your required differentiator: a BigQuery property graph, genuinely traversed.** Your agent
  must run a real multi-hop `MATCH`. A single-hop query, or a `JOIN` with the word "graph" in the
  variable name, does not count — and it is the most common way a team misses the point while
  appearing to hit it.

## The thing worth remembering while you build

**A graph makes a consequence visible. It does not make the decision.**

The most connected business in your corridor is not automatically the best investment — it may
simply be the most robust one. A business three hops downstream with a weak coefficient is barely
affected by anything. And two of your three edge types are modelled by us, which should change
how much weight a recommendation carries.

An agent that ranks by centrality and funds the top of the list has rebuilt Section 2's wrong
answer with extra steps. What you do *after* the traversal — deciding what exposure means,
what the money actually changes, and what you are assuming — is where this becomes useful instead
of merely clever.

See the README for the five syntax traps, and Section 13 of the notebook for the DDL shape.

# Headless fallback for notebooks/c3_01_load_explore.ipynb
#
# Rebuilds the same BigQuery tables the notebook produces, from a pre-staged
# snapshot in Cloud Storage. Use this when a Colab Enterprise runtime is slow or
# unavailable, or when one of the upstream publishers is not cooperating.
#
# Run it from the repo root in Cloud Shell (no chmod needed - invoke with bash):
#     bash scripts/load.sh                 # defaults to north-beach
#     bash scripts/load.sh 24th-st
#     bash scripts/load.sh --list          # show available corridors
#
# You still want the notebook if you can run it. It explains which of the
# connections in your graph are measured and which are modelled, and you will be
# asked about that. This script gets you the same tables without the teaching.
